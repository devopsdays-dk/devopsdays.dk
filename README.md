## The Danish DevOpsDays community's own home

The official home of all DevOpsDays chapters is on [devopsdays.org](https://devopsdays.org)

Where we are also represented with [devopsdays.org/denmark](https://devopsdays.org/denmark)

...BUT!

The static Hugo site set up per default looks like something from the 90ies, The repo is 3GB+ to download and each build rebuild the entire history of all events in all cities since 2009. A pull request to main can take weeks to get approved.

Therefore we came up with our own nimble static web for hosting the Danish conferences and events.

## The source is open

[This repository on github](https://github.com/devopsdays-dk/devopsdays.dk) is open for everyone to examine.

It's build in Jekyll, takes offset in the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). But we've created our own fork of that in [devopsdays-dk/minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/devopsdays-dk/minimal-mistakes).
