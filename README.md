# devopsdays.dk

## The Danish DevOpsDays community's own home

### Live at [www.devopsdays.dk](https://www.devopsdays.dk)

While the official representation of the Danish DevOpsDays chapter is required on [devopsdays.org](https://devopsdays.org/denmark). This repo holds the source for our own _true_  home on [www.devopsdays.dk](https://www.devopsdays.dk). Our site on `devopsdays.org` is merely a placeholder that redirects to this site.

### Why skip `devopsdays.org`

Well, the static Hugo site set up by the community looks like something from the 90ies, The repo (see [our fork](https://github.com/devopsdays-dk/devopsdays-web)) is 3GB+ to download and each renedering rebuilds the entire history of all events in all cities since 2009. A pull request to main can take weeks to get approved.

Therefore we came up with our own nimble static web for hosting the Danish conferences and events.

## The source is open

[This repository on github](https://github.com/devopsdays-dk/devopsdays.dk) is open for everyone to examine.

It's build in Jekyll, takes offset in the [minimal-mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). But we've created our own fork of that in [devopsdays-dk/minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/devopsdays-dk/minimal-mistakes). And while we have already made some modifications and additions to the theme, you can still trust [the documentation of the theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) to apply to our site too.
