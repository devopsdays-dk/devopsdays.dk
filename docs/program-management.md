# Program Management Guide

This guide explains how to manage event programs, talks, speaker profiles, and their relationships in the DevOpsDays Denmark website.

## Overview

The program management system consists of three interconnected collections:

1. **Programs** (defined in event front matter) - Event schedules with timing and talk references
2. **Talks** (`_talks/`) - Individual talk/session definitions linked to speakers
3. **Profiles** (`_profiles/`) - Speaker biographical information with images

## Collections & File Structure

### Talks Collection (`_talks/`)

Each talk is a markdown file in `src/_talks/` with the following structure:

```yaml
---
id: talk-slug                          # Unique identifier (matches filename without .md)
title: "Full Talk Title"               # Display title
speaker: speaker-profile-id            # References _profiles/{speaker-profile-id}.md
excerpt: "Short description..."        # One-paragraph summary
topics:                                # List of topic tags
  - devops
  - platform-engineering
events:                                # Events where this talk appears
  - 2025-aarhus
---

Full talk description and content here...
```

**Important Notes:**

- `id` must match the filename (e.g., file `green-devops.md` should have `id: green-devops`)
- `speaker` should reference a profile ID by filename (e.g., `paulina-dubas` for the file `paulina-dubas.md`)
- **Do NOT include a `permalink` field** - it's auto-generated by Jekyll based on `_config.yml`: `permalink: /:collection/:title/`
- The `title` field becomes both the page title and the permalink slug

### Profiles Collection (`_profiles/`)

Each speaker profile is a markdown file in `src/_profiles/` with this structure:

```yaml
---
name: Speaker Name                     # Display name
headline:                              # Short professional title (optional)
image: speaker-name.webp               # Image filename (convention: assets/images/profiles/)
company:                               # Company/organization (optional)
email:                                 # Email (optional)
cell:                                  # Phone (optional)
pronoun:                               # Pronouns (optional)
location:                              # Location (optional)
social:                                # Social media links
  x: username
  linkedin: username
  github: username
  website: https://example.com
roles:                                 # User roles
  - speaker
events:                                # Events where this profile appears
  - 2025-aarhus
---

```

**Image Convention:**

- Store images in `src/assets/images/profiles/`
- Reference them in the `image:` field as **filename only** (e.g., `paulina-dubas.webp`)
- The talk layout automatically prepends the full path: `/assets/images/profiles/{image}`
- Recommended: WebP format for better compression
- Size: 120px × 120px (displayed in talk sidebars)

### Programs (Event Front Matter)

Programs are defined in event files (`_events/2025-aarhus.md`) as YAML data structures:

```yaml
day-one:                               # Program identifier
  caption: "April 29, 2025"            # Display heading
  start: "8:30"                        # Start time (quoted to force string, not sexagesimal)
  program:                             # Array of program items
    - caption: "Registration"          # Caption-only item
      duration: "0:30"
      color: "#aceaff"                 # Optional: background color
    
    - talk: green-devops               # Single talk reference
      duration: "0:30"
      color: "#aceaff"
    
    - caption: "Ignite Talks"          # Caption with nested talks
      duration: "0:45"
      talk:                            # Array of talk slugs
        - post-accelerate
        - big-waves
      color: "#c4ffd7"

day-two:                               # Another program section
  caption: "April 30, 2025"
  start: "8:30"
  program:
    # ... more items
```

```

## Displaying Programs

Use the `program` include in event layouts:

```liquid
{% include program id="day-one" %}
{% include program id="day-two" %}
```

The include automatically:

1. Parses start times and calculates cumulative times for each item
2. Looks up talk details from `site.talks` collection
3. Fetches speaker information from the talk's `speaker` field
4. Renders speaker names and profiles
5. Applies color coding to items

## How-To Guides

### Adding a New Speaker + Talk to an Existing Event

#### Step 1: Create the Profile

1. Create `src/_profiles/speaker-id.md`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: Full Name
   image: speaker-id.webp
   company: Company Name
   email: email@example.com
   pronoun: they/them
   location: City, Country
   social:
     linkedin: username/
     x: username/
     github: username/
     website: https://example.com
   roles:
     - speaker
   events:
     - 2025-aarhus
   ---

   Write the speaker's bio here...
   ```

2. Add the speaker's image to `src/assets/images/profiles/speaker-id.webp`

#### Step 2: Create the Talk

1. Create `src/_talks/talk-slug.md`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   id: talk-slug
   title: "Full Talk Title"
   speaker: speaker-id
   excerpt: "One-paragraph summary of the talk"
   topics:
     - devops
     - security
   events:
     - 2025-aarhus
   ---

   Full talk description here...
   ```

#### Step 3: Add to Program

In the event file (`src/_events/2025-aarhus.md`), add to a program section:

```yaml
day-one:
  caption: "April 29, 2025"
  start: "8:30"
  program:
    - talk: talk-slug
      duration: "0:30"
      color: "#aceaff"
```

### Creating a New Event with Program

1. Create `src/_events/YYYY-city.md`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: DevOpsDays City YYYY
   excerpt: Event description
   layout: ticketbutler-signup
   header:
     teaser: /assets/images/events/path/image.jpg
   event:
     date: YYYY-MM-DD
     enddate: YYYY-MM-DD
     place: City, Venue
     ticketbutler-slug: slug
   ---

   day-one:
     caption: "Date"
     start: "8:30"
     program:
       - caption: "Welcome"
         duration: "0:30"
       - talk: talk-slug
         duration: "0:45"
   
   day-two:
     caption: "Next Day"
     start: "8:30"
     program: []
   ```

2. Create all referenced talks (follow "Adding a New Talk" steps)

3. Create all referenced speaker profiles (follow "Adding a New Speaker" steps)

### Managing Ignite Talks

Ignite sessions are multiple talks in one time slot:

```yaml
- caption: "Ignite Talks"
  duration: "0:45"
  talk:                    # Array of talk slugs
    - talk-one-slug
    - talk-two-slug
    - talk-three-slug
  color: "#c4ffd7"
```

Each talk in the array will be rendered as a sub-item within the caption block.

### Time Formatting

Times must be quoted strings in YAML:

**✅ Correct:**

```yaml
start: "8:30"
duration: "0:30"
```

**❌ Incorrect:**

```yaml
start: 8:30        # This is parsed as sexagesimal number 510!
duration: 0:30     # This becomes 0.5 hours
```

The program include handles:

- String format: `"H:MM"` or `"0:MM"` (e.g., `"8:30"`, `"0:45"`)
- Float format: `8.5` (hours.minutes as decimal) - automatically converted to HH:MM

## Common Issues

### Speaker Not Showing in Program

Check:

1. ✅ Talk's `speaker:` field matches the profile filename exactly (e.g., `paulina-dubas`)
2. ✅ Profile file exists at `src/_profiles/paulina-dubas.md`
3. ✅ Talk is referenced correctly in the event program (exact slug match)

### Talk Permalink Wrong

Check:

1. ✅ Talk's `title:` field matches what you want in the URL
2. ✅ No `permalink:` field in the talk front matter (let Jekyll auto-generate it)
3. ✅ Rebuild the site after making changes

### Images Not Showing

Check:

1. ✅ Image file exists at `src/assets/images/profiles/filename.webp`
2. ✅ Profile's `image:` field has **filename only**, not full path
3. ✅ Filename matches exactly (including case)

### Time Calculation Wrong

Check:

1. ✅ Event's `start:` time is quoted: `"8:30"` not `8:30`
2. ✅ All durations are quoted: `"0:30"` not `0:30`
3. ✅ Valid time format: "H:MM" or "0:MM"

## Technical Details

### Program Include Logic

The `program` include (`src/_includes/program`):

1. Parses the program data structure from event front matter
2. Converts start time to HH:MM format (handles quoted strings and floats)
3. Iterates through items, calculating cumulative time
4. For each talk reference:
   - Looks up the talk in `site.talks` collection
   - Extracts the speaker ID from the talk's `speaker:` field
   - Displays speaker name and profile link
5. Renders with semantic HTML (`<div class="program-item">`)

The layout applies CSS from `src/_sass/_talks.scss` for styling.

### Talk Layout (`talk.html`)

When visiting a talk page (`/talks/talk-slug/`):

1. Displays the talk title and excerpt
2. Creates a sticky sidebar with:
   - Speaker profile (image, name, link)
   - Topics (tags)
   - Events (where the talk appears)
3. Renders the talk content below

The sidebar uses:

- `site.talks` to get current talk's speaker
- `site.profiles` to look up and display speaker details
- CSS grid layout with `position: sticky` for sidebar
