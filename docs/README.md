# docs

This folder `./docs` is meant for detailed documentation that is relevant to share among all contributors. But which is also perhaps _too_ detailed to throw in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) since we aim to keep that crisp and nimble.

If you create MarkDown files in this repo, maybe consider _mentioning_ them in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
