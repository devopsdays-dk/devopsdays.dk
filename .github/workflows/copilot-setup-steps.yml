name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

# Automatically run the setup steps when they are changed to allow for easy validation, and
# allow manual testing through the repository's "Actions" tab
# The copilot workflow can only run in a standard ubuntu-latest environment, so we cannot use a 
# custom Docker image for it. Instead, we install the necessary dependencies in the workflow steps below.
