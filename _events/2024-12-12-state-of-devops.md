DevOps has been around since ≈2008, in that period of time the World has been gifted with distributed version control, declarative pipelines, containers, serverless infrastructure, social coding platforms, Deep Neural Network frameworks and Large Language Models with GPTs on top.

It's a crazy world of software, being eaten by software.

— _"Where does that leave contemporary DevOps?"_🤷‍♀️

Good question!

The [DORA 2024 report](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/announcing-the-2024-dora-report){: target="_blank"} certainly helps in trying to answer it. It's a 120 page report, based on a survey among more than 39K professionals. But we will break it down for you and serve it up in bite sized interesting lumps and then open up for discussions.

### _Our_ DORA, not _theirs_

_Ours:_ [DevOps Research and Assessment Institute](https://dora.dev/){: target="_blank"} (DORA)<br/>
_Theirs:_ [Digital Operational Resilience Act](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en){: target="_blank"} (DORA)

Although the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act is getting a lot of attention these days. It's not the _DORA_  we're referring to. In the DevOps world we have known DORA for exactly 10 years now — as something else.

Since 2014 The [DevOps Research and Assessment institute](https://dora.dev/){: target="_blank"} (DORA) has released their annual report on "State of DevOps". Start the day with us over a coffee and a croissant :coffee::croissant:. We will share and discuss the highlights of this year's anniversary report, recap on the four _DORA metrics_ and facilitate a discussion 💬 among DevOps peers.

### Who Should Attend?

If you are a leader or a manger of initiatives or teams even remotely related to _**DevOps**_ or _**DevX**_, then this is for you. If you are a hands-on professional DevOps'er then this is for you too. And who knows?<br/>— Maybe together we sow the seed to a small community; a breakfast club where we can inspire each other with DevOpsy things the really interests us.

**We will serve croissants, coffee, tea and fresh juice during the event.**
