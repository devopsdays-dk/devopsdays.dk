## Privacy Policy

This site is operated from an obligation and dedication to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of it's user's data, including personal data. I'm careful in on ensuring compliance with applicable data protection legislation, first and foremost the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Organizers

The responsible for this site are the organizers of the Danish chapter of DevOpsDays. If you have any questions about the data policy presented here, or if you need to report content you've found on these pages; please do not hesitate to [reach out to us](mailto:denmark@devopsdays.org){: target="_blank"}

## DevOpsDays Denmark is not a business

This is a volunteer - non-profit - site. On these pages each author speaks with her or his own tone-of-voice. On these pages the contributors are dedicated to sharing information and growing a community - not running a business. All material on theses pages is free. We deliberately use _authors_ in plural, as we may host material from others too, or invite individual to share their content. But the organizers remain the official _Editor in Chief_. We take the responsibility.

The main purpose is to expose and facilitate our DevOps passion for utilizing technology and digital solutions to drive meaningful outcomes for people. We love to share knowledge and experience with others. Most people in tech do. Therefore the stories have interactive discussions enabled, and you are encouraged to join and set your mark - all it takes is a GitHub Account.

We do not moderate or take the responsibility for comments made by individuals.

## Data controller

This site processes data - consequently we consider ourselves a _data processor_.  We maintain this role in compliancy with he GDPR rule set.

Our interpretation on maintaining this role is based on the EU commission's [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3721){: target="_blank"} which clarifies that for US companies that has signed the EU-US [Data Privacy Framework program](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/){: target="_blank"} and which offers [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){: target="_blank"}
that have been “pre-approved” by the European Commission, the legal implication of utilizing services from US based companies is considered _adequate_ to be fully comparable with that of obtaining similar services from EU based companies.

We carefully monitor, that we do not utilize services from US based companies unless they have signed the Data Privacy Framework program and offer SCCs in compliance with the EU Commission's recommendations.

As an example: We have a free organization account with GitHub. As part of this contract We've accepted GitHub's _Standard Contractual Clauses_ which are aligned with the EU commissions recommendations. GitHub has signed the _Data Privacy Framework program_ therefore; When we host this website through GitHub pages it's in compliance with the EU commission's recommendation of data transfer to 3<sup>rd</sup> party countries outside EU.

Same logic follows for the Google Analytics tags we use, since Google also offer terms that are compliant with the EU SCCs and they too signed the Data Privacy Framework program.

## The cookies we set

- We set one cookie of our own, to track that you answered 'yes' to use the site and let us use cookies
- We set two Google Analytics cookies, that helps us with insights into _how_ the guests browse the website.

## The site does not collect any PII data

Personally identifiable information (PII) is a legal term used to define any data that can be used to identify someone. We guarantee that we do not collect any _Personally Identifiable Information (PII)_ about _who_ you are.

On this specific low-fidelity site all data we track is anonymized and we do not elicit _any_ kind of PII data - not even your IP address.

## Embedded pages, services and redirects to other services

Occasionally this site may use embedded pages (`<iframe>`) or include other services (`<script>`). For instance that is the case for the ability to leave comments on some of the pages. The comments are hosted by GitHub. And pages may also embed Google maps or redirect to external sites, E.g. meetup.com or to signup to events.

On these external pages, wether embedded or redirected, you choose yourself, at your own will, if you want to sign in or not. How you act and behave on these pages and services - is considered outside the scope of the data policy you are reading here.

Also note, that on pages that we embed or redirect to, but do not host ourselves, there may be functional cookies set. When that is the case, these are beyond the scope of the cookie consent you have given to _this_ website.

If you find scripts running or cookies set, in the scope of this website, that you would like to question then we're happy to explain what's going on - reach out to us: [the organizers](mailto:denmark@devopsdays.org){: target="_blank"}.
