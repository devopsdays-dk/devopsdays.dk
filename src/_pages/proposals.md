## DevOpsDays 2026 in CPH still open for _some_ proposals

We have closed the CFP for _talks_. But we're still interested in suggestions and proposal to various _unconference_ formats.
{: .kicker}

[Propose unconference stuff](/out-of-season-proposals/){: .btn .btn--primary target="_blank"}

#### Examples

- **Ignite talks** (20 auto-advancing slides, 30 secs on each, 5 min in total)
- **Workshops** (20 minute workshops, in a standing crowd of ~20-50 people)
- **Lean Coffee Discussions** (Facilitated discussions on a specific theme in a standing crowd of ~20-50 people)

DevOpsDays is famous for being an _unconference_. On each conference day we have a long time-slot set aside for conferences participants engaging — usually in _Open Space discussions_ (which require no preparation). But we would very much like to experiment with other formats. SO if you have any ideas you would like to test in a crowd (max 30 mins) in a different format in front of a standing audience (no bums on seats) throw us a proposal.

## Out of Season proposals

The _Out Of Season Proposals_ form is not addressing a specific event or deadline. It is always open, even when our official CFP for a DevOpsDays event is not.

[Propose Out Of Season stuff](/out-of-season-proposals/){: .btn .btn--primary target="_blank"}

It's a way for you to get _anything_ off your chest at _any_ point in time. So if you have an idea for something you'd like to present use that form.

We're always interested in gathering good ideas for presentations and we may even hand-pick stuff from this backlog to our official events. So it's also a way for you to be top-of-mind in the program committee's consideration.

Along side the official DevOpsDays conferences, we collaborate with several Meetup groups and communities and we can possibly arrange for some in-between event.
