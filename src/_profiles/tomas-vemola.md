At some point I fell into a rabbit hole of randomized testing and never quite recovered. As a relative newcomer to the enterprise software industry, I have never understood why these techniques are not more widely adopted. I want to play a part in changing that so we can all spend less time on low-value testing.

I have done some well received internal talks in the past to audiences of 10-50 people, but nothing on record.
