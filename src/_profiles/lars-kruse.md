Throughout his entire career Lars has dedicated his focus on organizing software developer routines and chores in a way that fosters software with quality built-in — often GxP grade (life science), safety-critical (manufacturing industry) and high-trust (finance) and often with the added complexity of hardware-in-the-loop. At the core in achieving this he builds a continuous flow in software deliveries, through a high degree of autonomation and automation; anything-as-code.
