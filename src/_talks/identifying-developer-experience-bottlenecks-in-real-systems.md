Most developer experience problems don’t come from one dramatic failure. They come from dozens of small, persistent friction points that slowly exhaust teams: CI pipelines that are slow or unreliable, deployment workflows that require tribal knowledge, unclear ownership that turns simple changes into
Based on hands-on experience across DevOps, SRE, and platform teams, this talk focuses on how developer experience bottlenecks actually show up in real systems. We’ll look at recurring patterns such as broken feedback loops, hidden cognitive load, tooling that works in theory but not in practice, and observability setups that protect production while leaving developers blind during development and debugging. We’ll also explore how teams often misdiagnose these problems as skill gaps or process failures, when they’re really symptoms of accumulated DX debt.
Rather than proposing another framework or tooling overhaul, this talk is about learning how to recognize DX challenges early, using signals teams already have: deployment behavior, incident patterns, CI trust and the right metrics.
