Managing infrastructure is like surfing - each wave requires the right board and every environment - right tools.
In this talk, we'll explore how server management tools align with different scales of infrastructure. To make it more interesting, we'll correlate size of infrastructure with waves and tools with surfboards.

Three main parts:

1. Small Waves (1-2 servers)
2. Medium Waves (50 servers)
3. Big Waves (1000+ servers)

No demo. Just storytelling
