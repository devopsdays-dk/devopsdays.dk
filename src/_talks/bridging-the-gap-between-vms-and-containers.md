Despite the rise of containers and Kubernetes, virtual appliances remain a vital part of modern infrastructure. From networking and storage services to management and security components, these self-contained systems often do not require or fit into Kubernetes-like orchestration, yet they still demand reliability, consistency, and security.

This talk explores how Bootc brings modern platform engineering principles such as immutability, automation, GitOps, and declarative configuration to virtual appliances. By applying these concepts, Bootc enables the same predictable, versioned, and automated lifecycle we know from containerized environments, bridging the operational gap between traditional virtual machines and modern cloud-native systems.
