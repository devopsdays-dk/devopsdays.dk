Computers are astonishingly powerful - and yet, we use little of that compute during the testing phase. Most teams still rely solely on example-based tests - tests that rely on providing a specific input and expecting a specific output.

However, there is a whole world of testing techniques that can help you make your software more reliable with less toil.

This talk is part an introduction to randomized/autonomous testing, part challenging some wide-spread beliefs folks hold about testing that might be preventing them from getting to the next level.

In no specific order, we will see thoughts and examples on: property-based testing, fuzzing, mutation testing, assertions, contract-driven development, determinism and general testing terminology.

Be the end I hope you come out inspired to try out these techniques - maybe even provoked!
