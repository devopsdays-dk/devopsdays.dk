Computers are astonishingly fast - and yet, we use little of their computing power to test our products. Most teams still rely solely on example-based tests - tests that rely on providing a specific input and expecting a specific output. In that case, the computer cannot help much besides running all the examples.

However, there is a host of testing techniques that can help us make our software more reliable with less toil.

This talk is part an introduction to randomized/autonomous testing, part challenging some wide-spread beliefs we hold about testing that might be preventing us from making use of them.

In no specific order, we will see thoughts and examples on: property-based testing, fuzzing, mutation testing, assertions, contract-driven development, determinism and general testing terminology.

Be the end I hope you come out inspired - maybe even provoked - to try these techniques!
