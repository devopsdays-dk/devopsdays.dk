StudyHub is a suite of Digital Products centered around improving the planning of Clinical Trials within Novo Nordisk through the use of Agentic AI and an Event Driven backend.

This session will take a deep dive into how we have taken a thin platform approach across 7 digital products and used it to

- increase reusability of infrastructure as code
- increase use of pipeline templates
- strive for simplicity
- plug and play cloud infrastructure for software engineers, data engineers and data scientist
- not compromise on flexibility and extendability
- ease onboarding of new services

You will learn how we structure our infrastructure as code and pipelines with the consumer in mind, so they don't have to create the same resources from scratch over and over again, avoid the hassle of configuring access, and instead focus on delivery value to our users
