So you find yourself in AI land because the CXO said it was important.
We now have systems utilizing traditional ML systems to GenAI and everything in between.

Bring your towel and lets explore a practical demo of how MLOps can be implemented together with some generalized learnings about going from one model to hundreds of models in production.
