I have done a survey of a team's experience of using Main-as-Default Trunk Based Development with Non-blocking reviews. 
What we found out is that teams don't need to adopt TDD, Pair Programming or other similar QA-defensive mechanisms to adopt Trunk Based Development. 
Instead reducing friction, getting early feedback and delivering in small increments appears to create quality and robustness in itself. 

I have written an article about it here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wont-main-break-all-time-your-team-commit-straight-martin-mortensen-tkztf/
