AI-driven development and modern DevOps practices like platform engineering promise revolutionary changes but often fail to scale across entire organizations. This session explains why these transformations frequently fall short in the beginning and highlights the challenges organizations encounter.

Through case studies of companies that successfully scaled these changes, this talk provides practical insights and a roadmap for better integrating new technologies. The presentation includes an understandable hands-on demo with clear explanations.

Key takeaways

- Developer platforms and AI-driven development are the two key initiatives in operational efficiency and driving breakthrough innovations.
- Although organizations may currently see ""only"" a 10% improvement in efficiency, this impact is still significant.
- Organizations tend to focus on the innovators, but the real benefits lie in the majority of the organization.
