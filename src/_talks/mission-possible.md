Creating a learning platform can seem like a "Mission: Impossible".
I have built and run several, with mixed results.
This session is about my failures, my learnings, and my success in the end, with an open-source solution that can be implemented by any company with a need for providing training to their users.
There will be live demos showcasing how to create both the platform, but also a DevOps training path.
