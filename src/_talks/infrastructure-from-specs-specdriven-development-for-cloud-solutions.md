Specifications are becoming executable artifacts. How do modern Spec-Driven Development (SDD) frameworks invert traditional infrastructure workflows? Instead of writing code and hoping documentation keeps up, you write specifications that generate implementation. 

Let's compare two leading frameworks (Kiro Specs, GitHub SpecKit) and examine their approaches to capturing architectural intent, enforcing consistency across teams, and preventing infrastructure drift.

Whether you're building greenfield systems or evolving existing cloud infrastructure, learn how to use specs as your single source of truth and why this matters at scale.
